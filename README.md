GymCoding – My Own Programming Language 💪

GymCoding is a small, experimental project where I’m creating my own programming language inspired by the gym. This is purely a learning project, still in progress, and far from complete.

About

GymCoding is meant to help me explore:

Language design and basic parsing

Simple variables, loops, and functions

Experimenting with interpreters

⚠️ This project is a work in progress. Many features are not implemented yet.

Current Status

Basic syntax parsing – in progress

Variables & datatypes – in progress

Loops & conditionals – in progress

Functions – not implemented

Error handling – not implemented

Getting Started

Clone this repository:

git clone <repository-url>


Check the src/ folder for code

Try small experiments in examples/

Note

This is a learning project. Don’t expect a full programming language yet!
